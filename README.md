# 📚 BookStore Database Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive database design and implementation task aimed at creating a **MySQL-based relational database system** for a Bookstore. It simulates real-world scenarios where database administrators are required to manage complex, interconnected data systems.

By building this database, we demonstrate our skills in:
- Database design and modeling
- Writing SQL scripts to create tables and relationships
- Managing user roles and permissions
- Querying data to extract meaningful insights

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used

- **MySQL** – For building and managing the database

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a well-structured relational database that supports the operations of a bookstore, including managing books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping processes. The database ensures efficient data storage, quick retrieval, and robust security for different users.

## ✅ Key Deliverables

1. A fully functional MySQL database named `bookstore_db`
2. Optimized schema for each table with appropriate data types
3. Implementation of user roles and access controls
4. Sample queries to test and demonstrate database functionality

## 🔒 User Roles & Access Control

- Implemented role-based user groups to ensure secure database access.
- Permissions were granted based on the principle of least privilege.

## 🧪 Testing & Querying

The database was tested using a set of **SQL SELECT queries** to:
- Retrieve customer order history
- Check current shipping status
- Analyze book sales
- Identify most active authors and publishers
